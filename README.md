# YOUTUBE-WEBSITE-CONTENT-SUMMERIZATION
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Groq API to summarize content from YouTube videos and websites. The user interface is built using Streamlit, where users can input a public URL (either a YouTube video or a standard webpage) and their Groq API key.
